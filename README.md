Hi there! This is my second attempt at building the Project: Calculator.

Wish me Luck!


February  3, 2025
I have learned a lot while doing this project! I have fixed too many bugs!
I'm not sure if there still a bug, but yes, I think I finish this now! I think so...
I did not commit too much on this project, I just comment every code for me to remember.

Note: Some selectors, I didn't used and I decided not to erase them for now.
I might used them in the future.

I will try to code this project again in the future, those comments will help me.
And next time, I will try to commit more, make it better and make it a clean code,

My Apologies for the messy code!

This project is very hard for my current skills that i have now. But I persevered, and completed this project.

If you see any bugs or have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know! Thanks!
